Engineering Leader focused on creating efficiency and empowering others to do the same.

I enjoy breaking down technical & product problems - whether they be within code, systems, processes, user-experiences, or teams.

I believe in empowering engineers in driving bottom-up decision making.

I coach engineers toward their long-term goals and provide honest feedback.

Fulfilled by spreading smiles.
